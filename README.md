# SpotifyImmersive
Reverse-engineered the Spotify Web Player (desktop site) to inject custom JavaScript via a Tampermonkey script, adapting the interface for a more mobile-friendly experience. This is done entirely client-sideâ€”no API usage, no server interaction, and no redistribution of Spotify assets.

# Purpose:
Educational use only. Demonstrates DOM manipulation and UI adaptation techniques using browser extensions.
